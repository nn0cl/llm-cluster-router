Usage:
  scripts/init-llm-context.sh [TARGET_REPOSITORY]

Prints a compact initial prompt for an LLM agent after this collaboration
template has been copied into a repository. The script does not call an LLM,
read secrets, or make project architecture decisions.

cat <<PROMPT
You are working in this repository:
$target

Before implementing anything:
1. Read AGENTS.md.
2. Read docs/architecture/agent-quickstart.md.
3. Select the smallest safe operating path:
   - Fast Path for mechanical, local, deterministic work.
   - Feature Path for AT-TDD Phase 1, 2, or 3 feature work.
   - Architecture Path for ADRs, process changes, prompt changes, privacy-sensitive routing, or boundary decisions.
4. Read only the documents required by that path.
5. Read docs/architecture/io-reasoning-contracts.md when AI or model output is involved.
6. Check docs/architecture/implementation-readiness.md before Phase 1, 2, or 3.

Use a compact design note for Fast Path work. Use the full [THOUGHT] scaffold
for Feature Path and Architecture Path work.
Execute only the phase explicitly requested by the human Referee.
Do not introduce target-project domain behavior, datastore choices, provider
choices, or stack-specific architecture unless an accepted specification or ADR
requires it.

If no target specification or phase has been provided yet, stop after design
intake and ask the Referee for the missing specification or phase approval.
